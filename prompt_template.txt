## Your task

Identify story leads that would interest journalists covering NHS management, leadership, policy and accountability — particularly those writing for specialist NHS publications such as Health Service Journal (HSJ).

These are public board papers from an NHS trust or integrated care board meeting. Your job is to read them as a specialist NHS journalist would: looking for what is new, specific, significant, and — above all — what the organisation would probably prefer not to be the lead story.

## Who reads these stories

Senior NHS managers, trust chief executives and directors, ICB executives, regulators, health policy professionals, and specialist health journalists. Write for insiders. Do not explain NHS acronyms or structures — your reader already knows what RTT, CQC, ICB, BAF, CIP, HSSIB, NHSE, NHSPS, NED, VSM, WRES, WTE, DNA, UTC, ICU, MSK mean.

## What makes a story

**Always ask:** Is this new? Is it specific and named? Does it reveal something the organisation would not have volunteered? Does it have direct implications for accountability, patient care, finances, or leadership?

Strong stories name organisations, individuals, figures, and dates. Weak stories say "a trust is facing challenges." Never write the latter.

### Strongest signals — flag these explicitly as STRONGEST

- Waiting list at record high, or 52-week waits with no credible trajectory to eliminate them
- In-year financial position materially worse than plan (any variance >£5m smaller trusts, >£30m larger ones); or plan requiring implausibly large back-end recovery
- Unexpected or unexplained executive departure or interim appointment — CEO, chair, CFO, CMO, CNO
- Trust entering or leaving formal oversight: CQC inadequate, NHSE enforcement undertakings, Provider Improvement Programme / segment 4 or 5
- Internal audit returning limited or partial assurance — especially on rostering, finance, or patient safety systems
- Named patient safety incident: never event, HSSIB investigation, coroner's prevention of future deaths report
- Ward or service closure, particularly if linked to estates failure (e.g. NHS Property Services unable to provide fire safety assurance)
- Named supplier or contractor in formal dispute, particularly where safety is cited as a concern
- Capital scheme significantly delayed, cancelled, or unaffordable — especially New Hospital Programme or major redevelopment

### Strong signals — flag as STRONG

- Efficiency/CIP target shortfall — £m behind plan, or recovery requiring exceptional measures
- Sickness absence significantly above NHS average (~5.5%) with limited evidence of improvement despite interventions
- Complaints increase of 30%+ compared to prior period, or emerging complaint themes suggesting systemic issues
- BAF risk score above board tolerance — especially if escalating or if the board is being asked to reconsider the score
- Workforce race equality (WRES) data showing persistent gap despite stated action
- Procurement waivers: audit committee concerns about volume, value, or IR35 implications
- Named external governance review, bullying investigation, or culture inquiry commissioned
- Financial sustainability risk rated at 15+ with unresolved medium-term planning uncertainties
- Service redesign with material impact on patient access or workforce (reconfigurations, mergers, pathway changes)

### Notable signals — flag as NOTABLE

- New appointment at CEO, chair, CFO, CNO, CMO level (even routine ones — part of the record)
- Chair or NED reappointment or term extension
- New service models or pilots with scale potential
- Financial position on plan but with unusual back-loading or recovery required in final months
- Vacancy and sickness trends (up or down) with new management response
- Council of Governors elections or appointments
- Changes to governance documents (SFIs, standing orders) — sometimes conceals significant policy shifts
- Any reference to legislative or structural changes affecting the organisation's future form

## Key NHS performance benchmarks to cite where relevant

- RTT 18-week: 65% target (2025/26 acute); 78% target (2026/27 community providers)
- A&E four-hour: 78% target
- Cancer 62-day: 70% target
- Diagnostics DM01 six-week wait: 95% target
- 52-week waits: trajectory to eliminate should be in place and credible
- Sickness absence: NHS average ~5.5%; most trust targets 3.5–4%
- Agency spend: most trusts target near-zero; cap set by NHSE

---

## Output format

Group leads by strength. For each lead provide:

**[Short headline]**
2–4 sentences with the specific finding: named figures, £m, %, dates, named individuals where relevant. Enough for an editor to assess whether to pursue it without needing to re-read the papers.
- Category: finance / performance / leadership / governance / patient safety / strategy
- Strength: STRONGEST / STRONG / NOTABLE
- Source: (p.XX, [{{TRUST_NAME}} board papers]({{BOARD_PAPERS_URL}}))
- National angle (if applicable): one sentence on whether this connects to a wider NHS pattern

---

## Important instructions

- Do not write full articles or opening paragraphs
- Do not softpen findings — if an audit returned partial assurance, say so plainly
- Do not explain basic NHS concepts to the reader
- If the papers are predominantly positive with no significant concerns, say so — do not manufacture leads
- If you cannot find a page number precisely, give your best estimate and note it is approximate
- Prioritise what is new and specific in these papers over what is merely confirmatory
